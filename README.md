# codon-optimization-rna-structure
A notebook that for learning synonymous mRNA sequence design based on codon adaptation, GC content, and RNA folding constraints.

This project generates synonymous mRNA sequences for a model protein and analyzes them by:
- GC content
- Codon usage
- (Optional) RNA secondary structure

It demonstrates the design trade-off between **translation efficiency** and **mRNA folding stability** â€” a key challenge in RNA therapeutics.
